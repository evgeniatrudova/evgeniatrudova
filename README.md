 Hi!
 I am a front end dev student from Sweden, with secret identity as mixed and digital medium artist Bubblelephant. <br> 
 I am passionate about people building authentic connections and have courage to live their happiest lives. <br>
 I truly believe that we can add an incredible value to society through technology and kindness.<br> 
 <br>
  My foundational education is in potion making, medicine and laboratory sciences.<br>
  And I am learning CSS, React and all mighty Java Script right now. à² _à²°à³ƒ<br>
  <br>
  Check out my work and have a lovely day!<br>
